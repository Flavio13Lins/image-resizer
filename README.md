# Image Resizer & Aligner

## Overview

This Python project resizes and adapts all images inside a folder to a uniform size and proportion. It was created to solve the issue of misaligned images on websites by standardizing their dimensions. The script automatically detects the smallest image size, prompts the user for a target size, and resizes/crops all images accordingly.

## Features

- Bulk resizes images in a folder.
- Identifies the smallest image size.
- Allows users to set a target size.
- Maintains aspect ratio or crops images proportionally.
- Works with various image formats (JPG, PNG, etc.).

   ```
3. Follow the prompts to enter the image folder path and desired size.
